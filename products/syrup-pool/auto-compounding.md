# Auto NT Syrup Pool

## Stake NT, earn NT!

You've now got two delicious flavors of NT-NT Syrup Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

### What’s the difference between the “Auto NT Pool” and the “Manual NT Pool”? <a href="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your NT tokens to earn more NT tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual NT**

- You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your NT by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
- Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
- Deposits [SYRUP Token](syrup-pool-faq.md#whats-syrup-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto NT**

- Stake your NT and forget about it! The NT you stake in this Syrup Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
- The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
- Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
- A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
- An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
- Does not deposit SYRUP to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto NT Syrup Pool?

**Deposit fee**

- **None**

**Unstaking fee **

- **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
- Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
- After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
- The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more NT in the pool.
- This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

- **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
- For example, if the harvest was 1 NT, then 0.02 NT would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The NT collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular NT token burns.

This is a good thing for NT holders because it reduces the overall amount of NT tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto NT Syrup Pool? <a href="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your NT, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto NT bounty?

**Auto NT Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto NT pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto NT Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of NT you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
