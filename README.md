## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

Nortswap is the leading decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market (sources: [1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized) [2](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)).

### Low fees

Why pay more? Nortswap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, Nortswap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn NT and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Nort Pools

Stake NT, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.\
NT holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn NT with Nort Vault

Stake and Lock NT, earn even more NT.  The longer locked up, the more rewards you earn. You can also refer this service to your friends and earn more rewards directly to your wallet.

### Earn Trading Fees

No pools or vaults? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Pool page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

> Nortswap makes making money fun.
