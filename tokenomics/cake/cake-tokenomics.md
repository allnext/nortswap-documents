## **Emission rate** <a href="emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                | **Emission/block (NT)** | **Emission/day (NT)** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------: | --------------------: |
| Emission                                                                  |                      40 |             1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](cake-tokenomics.md#why-is-the-cake-burn-manual) |                   -25.5 |              -734,400 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                    |             **<14.5\*** |         **371,600\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 NT per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of NT is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 NT are harvested, then 9.09 NT is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All NT minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to               | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total NT) |           Reward/day |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ----------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms and Lottery            |                       11.25% |                     4.5 |     129,600 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned |                              |                         |              -45,000 |
| Syrup Pools                  |                          25% |                      10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily NT Emission**  |                              |                         | **371,600 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, NT is also burned in the following ways:

- **0.05%** of every trade made on Nortswap V2
- **100%** of NT sent to the Dev address
- **100%** of NT raised in IFOs
- **100%** of NT spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
- **100%** of NT bid during Farm Auctions
- **20%** of NT spent on lottery tickets
- **45,000** NT per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The NT for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
- **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy NT for burning
- **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto NT Pool
- **2%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy NT for burning

## Why is the NT burn manual?

To hit the ground running, Nortswap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the MasterChef contract emitting 40 NT per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the NT minting logic. As migrating to a new MasterChef would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce NT emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating two pools:

- Legacy Lottery Pool (PID - 137) - burned NT from the lottery
- Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned NT per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Chefs can adjust the percentage of the 40 NT per block allocated to it after each NT emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million NT.&#x20;

Don't worry -** THIS NT NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the NT that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The NT sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending NT isnâ€™t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm NT Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating NT supply shown on the Nortswap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the NT token contract on BscScan and [see how much NT is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of NT that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual NT supply.
