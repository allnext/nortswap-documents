# Roadmap

![](<.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-19- (1).png>)

Updated Oct. 13, 2021

### This is not a roadmap: It’s a to-do list.

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.

Pivoting is a way of life.

That means that we don’t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
Items in the Backlog/exploration phase have not been forgotten, they’re just lower priority in the immediate future than those in the other phases.
