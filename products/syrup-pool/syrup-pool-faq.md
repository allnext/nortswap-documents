# Nort Pool FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### **I can't find the Pool I was staking in!**

You should be able to find the Pool under the “Finished” tab on the Nort Pools page.

By selecting “Staked Only”, it will make it easier to find your assets.

### **Why did my earned tokens go to zero after staking/unstaking?**

Don’t worry! They’re in your wallet already.

Whenever you stake or unstake from a Nort Pool or vault, your earned tokens get harvested and sent to your wallet at the same time.

## **General Questions**

### How is APR for Nort Pools calculated?

> Nort Pool APR = Annualized rewards (USD) / User funds staked in Nort Pool (USD) \* 100

As a basic example, let's take a 60-day pool with 300,000 USD worth of rewards, and 3,000,000 USD worth of NT staked in it.

The APR fluctuates as more NT is staked by users, and as the price of NT, and the reward token, vary.

|                                                     | **Calculation**                  | Amount            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)             |                                  | 300,000 USD       |
| Distribution period                                 |                                  | 60 days           |
| Daily distribution                                  | 300,000 / 60 =                   | 5,000 USD daily   |
| **Annualised rewards (USD value)**                  | 5,000 \* 365 =                   | **1,825,000 USD** |
| **Value of NT staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                  | **3,000,000 USD** |
| **APR**                                             | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 = | **60.833% APR**   |

### **What does the “End” number on my Nort Pool refer to?**

This shows the amount of blocks left until the rewards for that pool stop being distributed. Once the pool has reached that block, you should unstake your tokens, because you won’t be receiving any rewards after that.

### **Where do the rewards from Nort Pools come from?**

There are three main types of Nort Pools.

1. Stake NT, earn NT
2. Stake NT, earn other tokens.
3. Stake other tokens, earn NT

The rewards for the "Stake NT, earn NT" Pools come from the [NT ](../../tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics.md)rewards tresury.&#x20;

The rewards for the "Stake NT, earn other tokens" type are provided by the project teams who sponsor a Nort Pool.

For the "Stake other tokens, earn NT" type, come from the [NT ](../../tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics.md)rewards tresury to distribute as rewards. These pools are funded by Nortswap, not by the projects themselves.
