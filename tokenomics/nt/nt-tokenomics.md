## How to Confirm NT Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating NT supply shown on the Nortswap homepage is correct,

1. Head to the NT token contract on BscScan and [see how much NT is held by the Burn Address.](https://www.bscscan.com/token/0xa752df1de29cddba6f1142db2a75d407092cce4b) That's the total amount of NT that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual NT supply.
