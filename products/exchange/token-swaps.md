# Token Swaps

## Token Swaps

[**Token swaps**](https://exchange.nortswap.finance/#/swap) on Nortswap are a simple way to trade one BEP-20 token for another via automated liquidity pools.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.25% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.03%** - Sent to the Pancakeswap Treasury.

**0.05%** - Sent towards NT buyback and burn.
