## Nort Vaults and Nort Pools

Vaults incentivize users to long term holding your token by distributing NT or your own token to your holders. And you can really do a work by refering it for your community and let the holders grows exponentialy.

Nort Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to BSC users who stake NT in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-paw on Nortswap: when a project provides their tokens for a Syrup Pool, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.

[Apply to run a Vault or Nort Pool](https://forms.gle/k4CAvP8eQpoT9gu26)

* Please don't email us to apply - we only respond to applications via the application form.
* Please don't chase us for a response on your application. We have a constant backlog of quality projects reaching out to us.

### How long will it take to get a response?

We aim to respond to applications within a week, but due to the large number of requests, we’re unable to respond to every single applicant. If you don’t hear back from us within **two weeks** of applying, try reaching out to [t.me/nortmaster](htps://t.me/nortm) on Telegram, with **the name of your project, your token ticker, and the date you applied**.

### What’s the difference between a Core Pool VS Standard Pool

A Core Farm is usually offered to projects who have shown excellent trading volumes on Nortswap and have met the standards of our internal review process.

### Can I get a larger pool multiplier? Or can I extend my Syrup Pool and Vault?

If you’ve already got an ongoing Pool and Vault, you may be able to extend the timeline via a Boost Pool. If you wish to increase the multiplier, the team will consider it if 30-day volume is increased. Contact us via your existing Nortswap communication channels for enquiries.



## Listing on the Exchange <a href="#exchange" id="exchange"></a>

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on Nortswap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/nortswap-exchange/nortswap-pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

The top 100 list is generated according to the highest volume for a specific period of time. As for the Extended list: projects hosting Vaults or Pools will usually be added, and other tokens chosen by Nortswap core team may also be added.

We don’t take applications for these lists. Users can still add your token manually by entering its contract address.

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

Please add your icon to Trust Wallet’s assets repo, which Nortswap references: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)

### Someone made a fake copy of my token! Can you block it?

Due to Nortswap’s nature as an AMM-based DEX, we’re not able to prevent the trading of any BEP-20 token. We recommend ensuring that your token contract is clearly visible and verifiable on your site, and educating your users about how to safely trade your token.

### People get an error when trading my token. What can I do?

Check our [Troubleshooting page](../help/troubleshooting.md) for a list of common errors on the exchange, and how to solve them.

## Something else

You can shoot us an email at suporte@nort.app.br if the above parts don't cover your questions.

Please don't try to contact us via this email for [customer support](customer-support.md), that's not what it's for and we won't respond: your best option for getting help with the product is via the [Telegram or Reddit community](telegram.md).
