## How can I stake NT?

You can stake your NT in Nortswap Syrup Pools. Visit the [Nort Pools page](https://nortswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Nort Pools guide](https://docs.nortswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and vault?

Staking in Nort Pools and Nort Vaults  are both ways to earn more NT by supporting Nortswap.

Staking only needs some NT to be added to a Nort Pool to earn NT or other tokens.\
[Learn more about Nort Pool staking.](https://docs.nortswap.finance/products/syrup-pool)

Vault is the same as Pool, but your tokens are locked for a certain period of time and you can earn even more by referring your friends to your link.\

## Is Nortswap protected from flashloan attacks?

Nortswap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. Nortswap’s NT token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, NT token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

Nortswap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
